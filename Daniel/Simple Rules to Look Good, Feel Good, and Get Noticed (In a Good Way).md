# Simple Rules to Look Good, Feel Good, and Get Noticed (In a Good Way)

## 1. Shower Every Day  
Nobody likes body odor. Get clean, smell fresh. Don’t forget to use **soap**, shampoo your hair, and wash your face.

## 2. Brush Your Teeth Morning and Night  
Clean breath = confidence. Gross breath = people backing away. Easy win.

## 3. Wear Deodorant Daily  
Even if you don’t think you need it, you do. Especially after gym class or on hot days.

## 4. Do Your Hair  
Wash it often enough to stay clean (not greasy), and style it in a way that looks like you *meant* to leave the house that way.

## 5. Don’t Wear the Same Top Two Days in a Row  
Even if it’s your favorite hoodie. Rotate your shirts. Clean clothes = fresh look.

## 6. Fold Clothes Right After the Dryer  
Wrinkles make you look like you slept in your clothes. Fold them quick, look sharp.

## 7. Wear Clothes That Fit  
Baggy or too-tight clothes don’t look good. Wear stuff that fits your body right now, not your old stuff from last year.
  **Let us know when things don't fit right, don't be afraid to push for a style you like**

## 8. Keep Your Shoes Clean  
You don’t need brand-new kicks — just keep them looking decent. Wipe them down if they get dirty. This is more applicable as you get older and your feet stop growing.
**If the shoes don't fit, get some that do!**

## 9. Use Lotion if You’re Dry or Ashy  
Elbows, knees, hands — don’t walk around looking like you wrestled a chalkboard.

## 10. Look People in the Eyes When You Talk  
It shows confidence, even if you’re nervous. Confidence gets noticed.

## 11. Keep Your Room (and Backpack) Clean  
Messy life = scattered mind. Organized guys stand out because they *seem* more mature.
**You do pretty well at this, proud of you.**

## 12. Be Kind, Not Cringe  
Teasing, showing off, or trying too hard to be funny doesn’t work. Being chill, respectful, and nice to *everyone* does.

## 13. Don’t Obsess Over Impressing Girls  
Be the guy who’s focused on himself, his goals, and being cool with everyone — girls notice *that*, and thats a **good** thing. :-)
